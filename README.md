This is basically the TL;DR for my Diving into Ecto series. I always hate having to skim a long blog post looking for a quick answer, and I know you do too. With that in mind I'm going to make this post a list of common and not so common queries you can do with Ecto. I will keep it up-to-date as I discover more interesting queries and ways of using Ecto. 

The repo with this post reproduced in the README can be found at [https://github.com/parkerl/ecto_query_library](https://github.com/parkerl/ecto_query_library). The queries below can be found in a usable form in `lib/queries.exs`. If you find something incorrect please open a pull request. I would like to make this a community resource rather than my personal toolbox. 

For the full story behind this project and the queries start here [Diving into Ecto: Part 1](http://www.glydergun.com/diving-into-ecto/).

# Versions
_The query library is currently built using the following setup. Some features are only avaiable on Ecto master. I will strive to indicate which queries will only run on master._

 - Elixir 1.1.1
 - Ecto master
 - Postgres 9.4

# Simple Queries with Different Select Styles
_Demonstrates how the various select styles change the return structure._

join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
group_by: fisherman.name,
select: [max(fish.length), fisherman.name]
```

# Order By
_Demonstrates ordering ascending and descending._

```elixir
from fisherman in Fisherman,
order_by: fisherman.name,
select: fisherman.name

21:50:02.022 [debug] SELECT f0."name" FROM "fishermen" AS f0 ORDER BY f0."name" [] OK query=4.0ms
["Joe", "Kirk", "Lew", "Mark"]

21:50:02.025 [debug] SELECT f0."name" FROM "fishermen" AS f0 ORDER BY f0."name" DESC [] OK query=0.5ms
["Mark", "Lew", "Kirk", "Joe"]
```

# Record with Max Value in Two Steps
_Demonstrates interpolating the result of one query into another._

```elixir

biggest_fish = from fish in FishLanded,
               select: max(fish.length)

Repo.all(
  from fish in FishLanded,
  join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
  where: fish.length == ^biggest_fish, 
  select: [fish.length, fisherman.name]
)
```

# Record with Max Value via Self Join
_Demonstrates left joins, self joins, and conditions in joins. Calculates the
record with a maximum value by "folding" onto the same table._

```elixir
from fish in FishLanded,
left_join: bigger_fish in FishLanded, on: fish.length < bigger_fish.length,
join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
where: is_nil(bigger_fish.id),
select: [fish.length, fisherman.name]
```

  ),
select: [fish.length, fisherman.name]
```

# Keyword Where<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkerl/ecto_query_library/master/master.jpg">
_Demonstrates the use of a keyword list for generating where clauses. Values are `AND`d. Also, shows that variables will be interpolated._

    {_, date} = Ecto.Date.cast("1976-01-05")

    Repo.all(
      from fisherman in Fisherman,
      where: [name: "Lew", date_of_birth: ^date]
    )
    
    => SELECT f0."id", f0."inserted_at", f0."updated_at", f0."name", f0."date_of_birth" 
    FROM "fishermen" AS f0 
    WHERE ((f0."name" = 'Lew') 
      AND (f0."date_of_birth" = $1)) 
      [{1976, 1, 5}]

    where(Fisherman, [name: "Lew", date_of_birth: ^date]) |> Repo.all
    
    => SELECT f0."id", f0."inserted_at", f0."updated_at", f0."name", f0."date_of_birth" 
    FROM "fishermen" AS f0 
    WHERE ((f0."name" = 'Lew') 
      AND (f0."date_of_birth" = $1)) 
      [{1976, 1, 5}] 
```

# Keyword Where Referencing Another Model<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkerl/ecto_query_library/master/master.jpg">

_Demonstrates referencing another model in a keyword where clause. Also shows that no join condition is required by `join`. It defaults to `ON TRUE`._

```
    join(Fisherman, :inner, [], fish_landed in FishLanded)
      |> where([fisherman, fish_landed], [name: "Lew", date_of_birth: ^date, id: fish_landed.fisherman_id])
      |> Repo.all
      
      => SELECT f0."id", f0."inserted_at", f0."updated_at", f0."name", f0."date_of_birth" 
      FROM "fishermen" AS f0 
      INNER JOIN "fish_landed" AS f1 ON TRUE 
      WHERE (((f0."name" = 'Lew') 
        AND (f0."date_of_birth" = $1)) 
        AND (f0."id" = f1."fisherman_id")) 
        [{1976, 1, 5}] 
```

# Where with In Clause

```elixir
from fish in FishLanded,
join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
where: fisherman.name in ["Mark", "Kirk"],
group_by: fisherman.name,
order_by: fisherman.name,
select: %{biggest_fish: max(fish.length), fisherman: fisherman.name}
```

# Where with Not In Clause
_Demonstrates the use of `not` to negate an in clause._

```elixir
from fish in FishLanded,
join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
where: not fisherman.name in ["Mark", "Kirk"],
group_by: fisherman.name,
order_by: fisherman.name,
select: %{biggest_fish: max(fish.length), fisherman: fisherman.name}
```

# Complex Muti-join Multi-where

_Demonstrates joins, sub-querying and using map syntax in the select. 
Uses the `date_add/3` function. Demonstrates how to accomplish a "between" where clause._

from fish in FishLanded,
  join: fly_type in assoc(fish, :fly_type),
  join: fish_species in assoc(fish, :fish_species),
  join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
  join: trip in assoc(fisherman, :trips),
  join: locations in assoc(trip, :locations),
  join: location_types in assoc(locations, :location_type),
  where: fragment(
    "? IN (SELECT MAX(biggest_fish.length) FROM fish_landed biggest_fish)", fish.length
  ),
  where: fish.date_and_time >= trip.start_date,
  where: fish.date_and_time <= date_add(trip.end_date, 1, "day"),
  select: %{
    length: fish.length,
    date_caught: fish.date_and_time,
    fish_type: fish_species.name,
    fly: fly_type.name,
    fisherman: fisherman.name,
    trip_start: trip.start_date,
    trip_end: trip.end_date,
    location: locations.name,
    location_type: location_types.name
  }
```

# Using a Select Fragment
## with Named Grouping and Positional Ordering

_Demonstrates how to use a named column from a fragment or a positional
column from an aggregate function in grouping or ordering._

```elixir
from fish in FishLanded,
group_by: fragment("date"),
order_by: fragment("2"),
select: %{
  date: fragment("date_trunc('day', ?) AS date", field(fish, :date_and_time)),
  fish_count: count(fish.id)
}
```

# Complex Select Logic Using a Fragment

_Demonstrates how to use multiple columns to calculate a value.
Also orders descending using positional column selection._

```elixir
from fish in FishLanded,
join: fisherman in assoc(fish, :fisherman),
order_by: [desc: fragment("1")],
select: %{
  bool: fragment(
    "((? = 'Kirk' OR ? = 'Mark') AND NOT ? < 10) AS crazy_select",
    field(fisherman, :name),
    field(fisherman, :name),
    field(fish, :length)),
  fisherman: fisherman.name
}
```


# Partial-preloading

_Demonstrates how to select only parts of a join model in a preload. 
Uses both map and list select syntax._

```elixir
    query = Fisherman
        |> join(:inner, [fisherman], fish in assoc(fisherman, :fish_landed))
        |> where([fisherman], fisherman.id == 1)
        |> select([fisherman, fish], %{fisherman: fisherman, length: fish.length})
        |> preload([fisherman, fish], [fish_landed: fish])

    Repo.one(query).fisherman.fish_landed |> IO.inspect

    query = Fisherman
        |> join(:inner, [fisherman], fish in assoc(fisherman, :fish_landed))
        |> where([fisherman], fisherman.id == 1)
        |> select([fisherman, fish], %{fisherman: fisherman, length: fish.length})
        |> preload([fisherman, fish], [fish_landed: fish])

    fisherman = Repo.one(query) |> List.first
    fisherman.fish_landed |> IO.inspect
```

      add :identifier, :string
      add :name,       :string

      timestamps
    end
  end
  
# Inserting data
    Repo.insert Ecto.Model.put_meta( %Account{ identifier: "lew@example.com",  name: "Lew"  }, prefix: "users" )
    Repo.insert Ecto.Model.put_meta( %Account{ identifier: "mark@example.com", name: "Mark" }, prefix: "users" )
    Repo.insert Ecto.Model.put_meta( %Account{ identifier: "john@example.com", name: "John" }, prefix: "users" )
